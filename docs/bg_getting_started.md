## Collect your parts

Here are all the parts required to build an ABall with acrylic case.  See the Parts List above for details.  A case is strictly optional, and I've used protoypes without one....but the bottom plate is essential as it's what everyting else bolts on to.  

In this photo the sensor is upside down, with the lens assembly pointing down.  In most of these other photos 
you'll see this sensor facing upwards, so it can keep an eye on the ball... so to speak.  There is a plastic
lens assembly that only fits on one way.  You don't need to secure this in place at all and you'll see some 
shots with, and some without it.  It's definitely needed for the sensor to work, so don't loose it.

### Bearings and Ball - Your point of contact
I've included information about the bearings in the BOM, but here is a closeup of the ones I prefer.  The price difference is not much for pretty much top of the line, and it's really the biggest determiner of feel apart from the ball itself.  The size I selected is fairly common for RC cars, planes, etc.. so you should be able to find a good variety.

As for balls, I've designed this around 38mm balls.  You can go a bit larger, or smaller, and the overall support will work, but cases may not fit properly.  This is a pretty standard size for mini billlard balls, but you an also get full steel ball bearings of this size if you like a heavy roll.  I've tried this, and I can't say I recommend it, but there are plenty of possibilities!  


Now that you have all your pieces together, let's start with the [electronics](../docs/bg_electronics.md)!
